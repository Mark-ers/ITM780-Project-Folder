    I am currently finishing my degree in Business technology Managemnent at TMU. Upon completion, I hope to become a data analyst.
    My program is a degree completion program, half of which was completed at Seneca Polytechnic and the other half will be completed at TMU.
    Additionally, there are several courses within the program which provide specific skills which are indispensable for data analytics.

           <p>Entrepreneurship has always interested me. Upon completing the second program at TMU, I hope to one day start my own business. 
            During both the Helix and DMZ programs, I attended several sessions where the basics of entrepreneurship were taught.
            These basics included finance, marketing, creating a business model, business law, and how to create an e-pitch.</p>
